**1. List all of the main states a process may be in at any point in time on a standard Unix system. Briefly explain what each of these states means.**
1. started/created = The initial state of a process where it has been created but isn't ready to run

2. ready - the process has reached a point where it is ready to run and is waiting to be assigned  aprocessor by the operating system
3. running - the processor is executing the process' instructions
4. waiting - the process waits for user input or a resource to continue
5. terminated - the process ends, it either finished its instructions or the operating system terminated it.
6. zombie - when the process gets terminated but hasn't been removed from the process table


**2. What is a zombie process?**
a process that has been terminated but still has an entry in the process table.


**3. How does a zombie process get created? How does one get destroyed?**



**4. What are some of the benefits of working in a compiled language versus a non-compiled language? More specifically, what benefits are there to be had from taking the extra time to compile our code?**
